# Project README: AI News Retrieval Pipeline Using Open Source Tools: Starling7B, BART, and LangChain

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive summarization pipeline leveraging the powerful capabilities of the **Starling7B** (based on Mistral7B), **BART**, and **LangChain**. The primary goal is to efficiently scrape articles from RSS feeds, generate summaries, and facilitate interactive querying through a retrieval-augmented generation approach. By querying summaries instead of the entire text, the retrieval process becomes significantly more accurate, allowing for precise and contextually relevant results.

## Installation

To run the project, ensure you have Python 3 installed. The necessary libraries can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas accelerate transformers tokenizers bitsandbytes einops xformers langchain faiss-gpu sentence_transformers torch
```

# Project Structure

- **scrape_and_summarize.py**: Script to fetch articles from RSS feeds and summarize them.
- **models/**: Contains the code for loading and utilizing the Starling7B and BART models.
- **data/**: Directory to store scraped data and summaries.
- **output/**: Directory where the structured summaries will be saved as CSV files.

# Usage

## Fetching and Summarizing RSS Feeds

- The script fetches RSS feeds from predefined sources.
- Articles are scraped, and their content is summarized using the BART model.

## Storing Summaries

- Summaries are stored in a structured format (CSV) for easy retrieval and further processing.

## Querying the Summaries

- The summaries can be queried interactively using LangChain, with responses generated by the Starling7B model.

### Why Querying Summaries?

By querying summaries rather than the full text, the retrieval process becomes more accurate. This ensures that the returned results are highly relevant to the user's query, filtering out extraneous information and focusing on the most important points.

# Model Details

## Starling7B (Mistral7B-based)

Starling7B is a large language model derived from the Mistral7B architecture. This model is designed to handle large-scale natural language processing tasks and has been fine-tuned for generating high-quality, contextually relevant responses.

**Key Features:**

- **Quantization**: Utilizes bitsandbytes for 4-bit quantization, making it memory efficient while retaining performance.
- **Integration with LangChain**: Serves as the backbone for the conversational retrieval chain.

## BART

BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) is a transformer model that is particularly effective for text summarization tasks. In this project, BART is employed to generate concise summaries of scraped articles.

**Key Features:**

- **Transformer-based Architecture**: BART uses a combination of bidirectional and auto-regressive transformers, making it versatile for tasks like summarization and translation.
- **Performance**: Highly effective in generating human-like summaries that capture the essence of the source material.

# LangChain Integration

LangChain is utilized to build a conversational retrieval chain. This integration allows for interactive querying of the summarized data, with responses being generated using the Starling7B model. The use of LangChain facilitates the retrieval of relevant summaries and ensures that the output is contextually appropriate. By focusing on summaries, LangChain enhances retrieval accuracy, providing precise answers aligned with the user's intent.

## Example Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Load the models (Starling7B for generation, BART for summarization).
2. **Scrape Articles**: Use BeautifulSoup to scrape articles from RSS feeds.
3. **Summarize Content**: Apply BART to generate concise summaries.
4. **Query and Retrieve**: Utilize LangChain and Starling7B to query the summarized content interactively.
